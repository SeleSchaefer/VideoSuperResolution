# To-Do Lists

## Biwi Clusters
- [x] Access Biwi clusters and do simple calculation (prime numbers)
- [x] Install CUDA (https://git.ee.ethz.ch/baumgach/biwi_tensorflow_setup_instructions/tree/master)
- [x] Install and execute torch training on cluster (https://git.ee.ethz.ch/baumgach/biwi_tensorflow_setup_instructions/tree/master) 
- [x] Install specific torch version as specified in BIWI wiki (Biwi wiki)

## Knowledgebase
- [x] Read papers about image super resolution in general
- [x] Read papers about video super resolution in general
- [x] RNN and GAN training in pytorch tutorials
- [x] Read papers about task aware image superresolution

## Implementation of task-aware image downscaling
- [x] Build image processing, training pipeline and network architecture (downscaling for 
I_guidance bicubic with anti-alising, cropping to factor of 2, normalization, 6 patches of 
96 Ã— 96 HR sub images each coming from different HR image --> mini-batch, Adam Optimizer, 
guidance and SR L1 losses, inverse pixel shuffeling module incl. testing, resblock module, 
general network architecture)
- [x] Restructuring project to be general use (yaml -> input arguments, "intelligent" checkpoints, 
automated saving and easy loading of previous training iterations, block-loss-function, etc.)
- [x] Test implementation using MNIST dataset (errors: no denormalization for saving, 
downscaling did not preserve input pixel intensity range, GPU training --> custom dataloader, 
num_workers=0 for test))
- [x] Training of TAD network on DIV2K dataset for scale=2 on small set (overfitting)
--> fix wrongly colored SR images bug (renormalization to [0,1], image saving integer division)
--> fix dark, one-channel-only SR images bug (discretization in fine-tuning only)
- [x] Loss graph in logarithmic and linear scale
- [x] Training of TAD network on whole DIV2K dataset 
- [x] Trainer generalizen (HR, LR print dependent on self.ckp.log.shape[-1] and descriptions, 
which depends on self.args.model_type argument)
- [x] Testing framwork for multiple datasets at the end of training with several dataset 
(input argument, Set5, Set14, B100, Urban100, DIV2K) and listing several information
(for several scales: PSNR -> best, second best; runtime)
- [ ] Extreme image downscaling (save SHR images next to bicubic downsampled image)
