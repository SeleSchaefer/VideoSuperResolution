\begin{itemize}
  \item PSNR for different scales
  \item Noise vs performance
  \item different lambdas
  \item time vs network size
  \item approaches of video scaling, i.e. flow, direct external
  \item noise resistence normal downscaling vs tar downscaling
  \item large scales (training directly, performance of other non-trained scales)
  \item scale and colorization for x4
  \item super large scale for videos
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
  \item torch - implementation of inverse pixel shuffeling
\end{itemize}

% Describe the evaluation you did in a way, such that an independent researcher can repeat it. Cover the following questions:
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item \textit{What is the experimental setup and methodology?} Describe the setting of the experiments and give all the parameters in detail which you have used. Give a detailed account of how the experiment was conducted.
%  \item \textit{What are your results?} In this section, a \emph{clear description} of the results is given. If you produced lots of data, include only representative data here and put all results into the appendix.
% \end{itemize}
