\begin{itemize}
  \item PSNR for different scales
  \item Noise vs performance
  \item time vs network size
  \item colorization, video sr, image sr
\end{itemize}


% Describe the evaluation you did in a way, such that an independent researcher can repeat it. Cover the following questions:
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item \textit{What is the experimental setup and methodology?} Describe the setting of the experiments and give all the parameters in detail which you have used. Give a detailed account of how the experiment was conducted.
%  \item \textit{What are your results?} In this section, a \emph{clear description} of the results is given. If you produced lots of data, include only representative data here and put all results into the appendix.
