\noindent Image reconstruction is a classical problem in computer vision.
While most of the state-of-the-art approaches for image reconstruction
focus on upscaling only, taking both down- and upscaling into account
offers the possibility to improve reconstruction performance while keeping the
image compression rate constant. Recent work has shown the feasibility of task
aware downscaling for the single-image-super-resolution and the image-colorization
task, focussing on the image domain only and excluding external effects.
\newline
Within this work advances task aware downscaling is advanced by analysing the
effect of perturbation and enhancing robustness and efficiency for super-resolution
and colorization in the image domain, by improving both the model architecture and
training procedure. As a result for the super-resolution task a model with $44 \%$
less parameters could be derived, while having a similar accuracy. For the
image-colorization task the reconstruction performance could be improved by
$31 \%$ with a slightly larger model. In addition, this work introduces a
training architecture to extends the task aware downscaling approach from the
image to the video domain.
